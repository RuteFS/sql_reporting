# Healthcare Reporting Project

This project simulates a **reporting workflow for a healthcare provider**, designed to showcase SQL skills for data extraction, transformation, and reporting.

It includes:
- Sample datasets (patients, appointments, treatments)
- SQL scripts to create and populate tables
- Reporting queries to generate **monthly summaries** (active patients, treatments, revenue)
- Data quality checks (handling missing or duplicate data)

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL querying (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY)
- Aggregations and calculated fields for **reporting**
- Data cleaning and validation using SQL
- Building structured workflows for **analytics and reporting**

## How to Use
1. Use `01_create_tables.sql` to create the schema (tables).
2. Use `02_insert_data.sql` to populate tables with sample data.
3. Run `03_reporting_queries.sql` to generate key reports:
   - Monthly active patients
   - Revenue per treatment type
   - Average session duration
4. Run `04_data_quality_checks.sql` to validate data integrity.

## Tools
- SQL (compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- Sample CSVs for testing and loading data

This project was created as part of a **personal portfolio** to demonstrate SQL proficiency for **reporting and data engineering use cases**.
